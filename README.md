# Fullstack Developer Challenge
## Meme Generator
### Description

Imagine a **Single Page Web Application** that allows users to create and download/share their
own memes. <br>
Users should be able to choose from a selection of images that are fetched
from an API (e.g. https://imgflip.com/api get_memes) or upload their own images as the
basis for a meme. <br>
Users can then add two captions to the image, one on top and one at the bottom. Additional
features could be freely placeable captures and freehand-drawings. <br>
Once they are ready, memes can then be downloaded by the user or uploaded to a
database together with some additional information like title, category and creation date. <br>
Uploaded memes are presented in a public gallery. <br>
In the public meme-gallery memes can be up and down-voted by users and filtered by
category and sorted by popularity. <br>
Additionally one or more memes can be selected and
downloaded. <br>
Enhancing the functionality of the meme generator, users can create accounts and login to
save their personal images and share them on social media. <br>
### Coding
Please make sure to invest not more than two hours. <br>
During these two hours decide which
parts of the application you want to roughly sketch, create stubs for, etc. <br>
If you want you can also focus on one detail only and finish it during that time. <br>
In any case we want to see a bit of
your code! <br>
And we are interested in your overall approach and architecture, and your
thoughts and reasoning behind your decisions. <br>
### Documentation
We are way more interested in your thoughts and reasoning process than in the final
solution. <br>
So please make sure to document your decisions regarding <br>
- technology stack
- frontend framework
- backend framework
- database
- Architecture
- Delivery
. Please provide us with a zip of your code or a link to a repository.
- Discussion

Prepare to discuss the software engineering aspects such as maintainability, extendability,
stability, performance, security.
